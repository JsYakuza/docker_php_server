# docker-server-php
In this project i would like to create my personal php-server configs based on docker.
Here i used 4 docker containers and join them with docker-compose utility.
Mariadb as database, Nginx as web-server, PHP as programming language and PHPMYADMIN as database managment system.
Next aim write a simple application on this image.
